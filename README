Math is a better math library for JavaScript. Everything that's available under your 
good ol' Math object is available under the `math` prefix as well, but so much more 
too.

You can use math in the browser and in node.js. The library is subdivided into the 
submodules `math` and `random`. If you just need one or the other, or just want
easier shortcuts, do

    // create a basic shortcut
    math = math.math
    // this adds `math` and `random` to the window object, so 
    // you can use e.g. `random.integer()` instead of
    // `math.random.integer()`
    math.global()
    // in node.js
    math = require('math').math;

Or, in CoffeeScript:

    # in the browser
    {math, random} = math
    # in node.js
    {math, random} = require 'math'

Also take a look at these libraries: 

  * [summa](https://github.com/stdbrouw/summa), a small library for descriptive
    statistics in JavaScript and CoffeeScript.
  * [mathnetics](https://github.com/shanest/mathnetics), a mathematics library
    that makes it easy to handle sets, groups, vectors, matrices, planes and 
    more.
